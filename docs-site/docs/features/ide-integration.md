# IDE Integration

Reactor is designed to work seamlessly with your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Through dedicated plugins and extensions, you can automatically sync the files you are working on with Reactor's context, creating a fluid and efficient workflow.

## Supported IDEs

### Visual Studio Code

- **Extension**: [Reactor Connector on Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hyperspace-ng.reactor-connector)
- **Source Code**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DrOlu/reactor-connector-vscode-extension)

The VSCode extension automatically adds the currently active file in your editor to the Reactor context. When you switch to a different file, it replaces the previous one, ensuring the AI's focus is always on your current task.

### IntelliJ IDEA (and other JetBrains IDEs)

- **Plugin**: [Reactor Connector on JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/26313-reactor-connector)
- **Source Code**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/DrOlu/reactor-connector-intellij-plugin)

The IntelliJ plugin provides similar functionality, syncing the active editor file with Reactor's context. It is compatible with a wide range of JetBrains IDEs, including WebStorm, PyCharm, and GoLand.
